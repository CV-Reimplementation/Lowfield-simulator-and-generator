# Lowfield-simulator-and-generator
Graphical interface allowing the user to simulate low and middle field cranial MRI and generate 3D images with high and low SNR. The possible MRI sequences that can be simulated are: spin-echo, gradient-echo, inversion recovery (IR), double IR, FLAIR, diffusion, SSFP, turbo-spin-echo (TSE) with three different kspace trajectories (linear, out-in, and in-out).

Instructions for running the graphical user interface (GUI)

Step 1)
Open a terminal window from where you can run Python. 
This can be from any Python environment (Anaconda, Spyder, PyCharm, etc.).
Example: type "Anaconda prompt" in the search bar, if you want the anaconda terminal window.

Step 2)
Navigate to the path/folder where the GUI package is saved on your computer.
This is done via the "cd x" command that will change your current directory to x.

Step 3)
Run the Gui.py file.
This can be done by typing the following command:
"python GUI_MRI.py"
and pressing enter. The GUI will appear shortly after.

The GUI can also be used without running the code via an application. This is an executable (.exe) file that can be used on Windows systems. As of now there is now application for Mac operators but softwares such as WineBottler (https://winebottler.kronenberg.org/) can be used to run Windows programs on Mac.
