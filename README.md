# Lowfield-simulator-and-generator
Graphical interface allowing the user to simulator low and middle field cranial mri and generate 3D images with high and low SNR

Instructions for running the graphical user interface (GUI)

Step 1)
Open a terminal window from where you can run Python. 
This can be from any Python environment (Anaconda, Spyder, PyCharm, etc.).
Example: type "Anaconda prompt" in the search bar, if you want the anaconda terminal window.

Step 2)
Navigate to the path/folder where the GUI package is saved on your computer.
This is done via the "cd x" command that will change your current directory to x.

Step 3)
Run the Gui.py file.
This can be done by typing the following command:
"python GUI_MRI.py"
and pressing enter. The GUI will appear shortly after.

You also can use the GUI without running the code via the application (executable file)
